just checking degree if it is 1, take edge
we are going over vertexes to check their degree, if degree is 1, we take its edge
then we go over higher degree vertexes, if there aren't connected, we take their smallest cost edge

we can have a set S with unexplored vertices
take one vertice, if it is degree=1 put the vertice + the edge in the graph

but we have to connect the vertices  of degree 1 first
