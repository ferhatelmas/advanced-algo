First we need to prove that in any man-optimal stable matching, each woman has the worst partner that she can have in any matching (man-optimal = woman-pessimal).\\
Suppose the above assumption does not hold. Let $M_0$ be the man-optimal stable matching and suppose there is another stable matching $M_1$. Let the woman $w$ be matched with man $m_0$ in $M_0$ and with $m_1$ in $M_1$. Suppose that $w$ prefers $m_0$ to $m_1$. Then it is obvious that $(m,w)$ blocks $M_1$, since $m_0$ has no other better stable partner than his partner in $M_0$.\\
The same way it can be proved that a woman-optimal matching is man-pessimal.\\
Thus if a matching is both man-optimal and woman-optimal, it is implied that the man-optimal version of the stable matching and the man-pessimal version of the stable matching are equal and so are the woman-optimal and the woman-pessimal versions. But since the pessimal and the optimal matching are the same that implies that there can be only one matching.
